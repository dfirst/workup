    List view that optionally orders ``object_list`` by calculated
    score. Subclasses must defined a ``date_field`` attribute for the
    related model, that's used to determine time-scaled scoring.
    Ordering by score is the default behaviour, but can be
    overridden by passing ``False`` to the ``by_score`` arg in
    urlpatterns, in which case ``object_list`` is sorted by most
    recent, using the ``date_field`` attribute. Used for showing lists
    of topics and comments.
